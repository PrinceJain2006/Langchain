# LangChain Overview

- LangChain is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides modular components and tools that make it easier to connect language models with external data, APIs, and environments.

- LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development — all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves.

pip install -U langchain

# Why use LangChain?
- LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.

## Use LangChain for:

Real-time data augmentation. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain’s vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.
Model interoperability. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application’s needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly — LangChain’s abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.
